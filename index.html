            <h3>EU privacy regulator fines Meta 91 million euros over password storage</h3>

            <img src="https://www.bamboonine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/bigstock-Moscow-Oct-Meta-Lo-437891606-1024x688.jpg" alt="meta" style="width: 205px; height: 160px;">
            
            <div class="top-left">
                <p>Meta was fined 91 million euros, $101.5 million, by the European Union privacy regulator for inadvertently storing some users’ passwords without protection or encryption.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>The inquiry was opened five years ago after Meta notified <mark> Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC)</mark> that it had stored some passwords in 'plaintext'. Meta publicly acknowledged the incident at the time and the DPC said the passwords were not made available to external parties.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>"It is widely accepted that user passwords should not be stored in plaintext, considering the risks of abuse that arise from persons accessing such data," Irish DPC Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said in a statement.</p>                        <br>

                <p>"It is widely accepted that user passwords should not be stored in plaintext, considering the risks of abuse that arise from persons accessing such data," said Graham Doyle, the regulator's head of communications.

                    Doyle told AFP that the breach, which took place in January 2019, affected 36 million Facebook and Instagram users across the European Economic Area, which comprises the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.</p>

            <h3>SpaceX docks at ISS to collect stranded astronauts</h3>

            <div class="top-middle">
                <p>A SpaceX capsule sent to bring back two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) has docked.

                    The Dragon capsule, which has <mark> two empty seats for Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams</mark>, docked at 17:30 eastern time (22:30 BST).
                    
                    The pair arrived at the station on Boeing's new Starliner capsule for an eight-day mission in June, but were forced to remain there because of a fault discovered during the flight.</p><br>

                <p>They are now expected to return to Earth in February.


                    The Dragon capsule lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida on Saturday carrying Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov.
                    
                    Hague, who has done a previous stint on the ISS, and Gorbunov will join the space station's crew before taking Wilmore and Williams back to Earth.
                    
                    The launch had been scheduled for Thursday but was delayed because of Hurricane Helene, which has caused huge destruction across the south-eastern US, including Florida, in recent days.</p>

                        “This really is an American achievement that spans many generations of NASA administrators and over a decade of work,” said current Administrator Jim Bridenstine.

Steve Stich, the crew program’s deputy manager with NASA, said the vehicle was doing well after the splash-down.

The capsule, which was lifted out of the water by a boat using a crane, is due back on land by Sunday. The live stream showed its protective shell had been weathered from intense heat during re-entry.

            <h3>US to return a trove of nearly 300 history-spanning antiquities to India</h3>

            <img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2172943284.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill/f_webp" alt="pm modi with Biden" style="width: 320px; height: 200px;">
            <div class="top-right">
                <p>
                    <mark> The US is returning 297 history-spanning antiquities stolen or smuggled from India </mark>, many dating back centuries.
                    
                    Marking the handover, President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posed for a photo in front of several of the artifacts, during a recent meeting between the two leaders.</p><br>

                <p>In July, the US and India signed an agreement to protect cultural property by preventing illegal trades and streamline the process to return stolen antiquities back to India.

                    The relics — most of which are terracotta artifacts from Eastern India — are expected to be repatriated “shortly,” according to the Indian government in a statement on Saturday.
                    
                    The timing coincided with Modi’s visit to Biden’s hometown in Wilmington, Delaware, where the president held a Quad summit over the weekend, aimed at strengthening the close alliance between the US and India, Japan and Australia.</p><br>

                <p>“Prime Minister (Modi) thanked President Biden for his support in the return of these artifacts,” the India’s Ministry of External Affairs said.

                    Modi also noted the relics “were not just part of India’s historical material culture but formed the inner core of its civilization and consciousness,” according to the statement.
                    
                    <mark> The artifacts, ranging from sculptures to vases, belong to a period spanning from 2000 BCE to 1900 CE</mark>. Some are made of stone, metal, wood and ivory.</p>

            <h3>India has a new nuclear-capable ballistic missile submarine. But can it catch up with China?</h3>
            <div class="second-line">
                <p>
                    India’s second nuclear-capable ballistic missile submarine joined its naval fleet late last month, a move the government says strengthens its nuclear deterrent as New Delhi casts a wary eye at both China and Pakistan.
                    
                    But India is still playing catch-up, at least compared with China, as the People’s Liberation Army grows its fleet – as well as its land and air capabilities – amid simmering tensions along their shared border.</p><br>

                <p>The nuclear-powered sub, INS Arighaat – “Destroyer of the Enemy” in Sanskrit – will “help in establishing strategic balance” in the region, Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said at an August 29 commissioning ceremony at Visakhapatnam naval base, the headquarters of India’s Eastern Naval Command on the Bay of Bengal coast.

                    That balance currently tilts in favor of China, with the world’s largest navy by numbers, including six operational Jin-class nuclear-powered ballistic submarines that outclass India’s two – Arighaat and its predecessor in the same class, INS Arihant – in firepower.</p><br>
                <p>The Chinese subs can carry a dozen ballistic missiles with ranges of at least 8,000 kilometers (4,970 miles) and have the ability to carry multiple nuclear warheads, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, a non-profit organization promoting the development and deployment of missile defense for the United States and its allies.
                    Both 366 feet long with a 6,000-ton displacement, according to an analysis by the open-source intelligence agency Janes, Arighaat and Arihant carry K-15 Sagarika ballistic missiles that can be launched from four vertical launch tubes. But the range of the nuclear-tipped K-15 is thought to be only around 750 kilometers (466 miles), limiting the targets that can be struck from the Indian Ocean.
